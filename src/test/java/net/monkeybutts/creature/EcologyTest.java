Frost drakes mate for life, leaving their packs when they find a suitable mate. Mated pairs make a nest together, and the female lays a clutch of two to five eggs. Both parents care for their offspring when they hatch, and families usually form small packs until the young reach maturity at 5 years of age. At this point, the parents abandon their offspring, usually laying a new clutch of eggs in a new nest elsewhere, and leaving the f ledgling drakes to find their own adolescent packs to join.";
